# Protein Microparticle Image Analysis (MATLAB)

## Overview
This repository contains a **MATLAB-based image analysis pipeline** developed for the quantitative analysis of **protein-based microparticles internalized by cells**, with a primary focus on **robust single-cell segmentation using watershed-based methods**.

The code was designed for microscopy images of phagocytic cells interacting with protein microparticles (e.g., OVA-based systems) and enables reliable separation of single and aggregated cells, followed by microparticle detection and quantitative analysis.
